## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ! ⚠️
This is poorly made code that basically trains a neural network to identify clothes from the Fashion MNIST Dataset, this code is very badly done and probably not working properly at the time you are reading this.

## That being said, if it can help you, feel free to use it!

To execute it in a simple way, you just have to build the dockerfile with ```docker build -t afancyname /path/to/your/project/docker```. 
Then you can run it with ```docker run -it -v /path/to/your/project/:/app --rm afancyname```.
